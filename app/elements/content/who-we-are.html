		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p>We're the new Software Development company in town. And we're hiring! If you're excited by building software and working with people from around the world then you've come to the right place.</p>
		<p>Our company was started by a group of Indonesian developers who had the good fortune of working for companies in Silicon Valley, California. Now we've come back home to start our own company and build a new team, with the goal of bringing the Silicon Valley energy, creativity and work culture to Indonesia.</p>
		<p>One of our first clients is a company we know very well, having worked for them in the US. It is an exciting multinational company with offices in the US, Europe and Hong Kong.  If you join us, you will be working closely with their San Francisco-based software development team.</p>
		<p>This client has developed innovative technologies to get rid of a set of common frustrations on audio and web conferencing, such as not knowing who's on the call or being unable to mute annoying background noise.  This makes conference calls a lot simpler and more productive.  All conference participants know what's going on at all times, and the call leader has the ability to manage calls through a Web app, Outlook client and mobile clients including iPhone, Android and BlackBerry.</p>
		<p>You will be working on these apps, which are used by thousands of people to connect and get more done.</p>
